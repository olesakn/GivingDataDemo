### Goal
Create a simple single page application (SPA) using AngularJS that requires a user to search and display a list of books using the Google Books API (https://developers.google.com/books).

1. Display the first 40 books returned from the API with the keyword phrase "National Parks".
2. Display in the output the title, year published and description for each result.
3. Display a detail view of a book by clicking on the book in the results view.  
4. While in this view, add the ability to comment on the book (include Name, Review, and Rating).
5. Display all reviews that have been added to a book's detail view.
