Create a simple single page application (SPA) using AngularJS that requires a user to search and display a list of books using the Google Books API (https://developers.google.com/books).

1. Display the first 40 books returned from the API with the keyword phrase "National Parks".
- Display in the output the title, year published and description for each result.
- Display a detail view of a book by clicking on the book in the results view.  
- While in this view, add the ability to comment on the book (include Name, Review, and Rating).
- Display all reviews that have been added to a book's detail view.
